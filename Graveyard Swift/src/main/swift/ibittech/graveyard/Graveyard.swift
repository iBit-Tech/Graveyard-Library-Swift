    * Graveyard's current version.
    *
    * Version system:
    * A change from 1.0.0a to 1.0.0b means I've fixed a small bug that I've probably just
    * found a minute after a release, most often just a one-liner.
    * A change from 1.0.0b to 1.0.1a means I've fixed a moderate bug or added/changed a
    * small feature.
    * A change from 1.0.1a to 1.0.6a means I've fixed an annoying bug or added/changed a
    * feature or two (or a few).
    * A change from 1.0.6a to 1.1.0a means I've added dozens of new features or changed
    * dozens of features slightly.
    * A change from 1.1.0a to 2.0.0a means I've added tons of stuff, removed tons of stuff
    * and basically rewritten large parts of the code. After version 1.9.Xx, 2.0.0a will
    * be next. Note you may have to rewrite parts of your code if you rely on this library.
